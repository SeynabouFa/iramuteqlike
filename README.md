## Overview

`iramuteqlike` is an R package with tools to reproduce the
[IRaMuTeQ](http://www.iramuteq.org/) software analyses in R. The aim of
`iramuteqlike` is to facilitate text analyses and to improve
reproducibility in research.

The package use different methods to compute some analyses, hence, the
results can differ from the [IRaMuTeQ](http://www.iramuteq.org/)
software.

Please note that `iramuteqlike` is not related in any way with the
[IRaMuTeQ](http://www.iramuteq.org/) developer team.

You need to have some familiarity with the [R programming
language](https://www.r-project.org/) to use `iramuteqlike` main
functions.

Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and the Coursera course from John
Hopkins University [Data Science: Foundations using
R](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-foundations-r)
(free for audit students).
